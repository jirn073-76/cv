      <h3>Short CV</h3>
      <p>In 2021 I finished my diploma in Computer Science and Software
        Engineering at HTL Donaustadt with highest distinction. Afterwards, I
        started working in Investment Banking / QFin at RCB, developing tools for Structuring & Trading while studying
        Business Informatics at the University of Applied Sciences Technikum 
        Vienna. This is where I did a study abroad programme at the Iowa State
        University of Science and Technology (Ames, USA), where I majored in 
        Management Information Systems at the Ivy College of Business and got placed on the 2022 Dean's List.
      </p>
      <p>
        After returning at the start of 2023, I started work as a Software Engineer at IBM where I got
        involved developing AI Solutions. In the same year I enrolled in the
        Master's Programmes for Software Engineering at UAS Technikum (Vienna, Austria) and
        Computer Science at Università degli Studi Guglielmo Marconi (Rome, Italy). 
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2024 I started my work for the City of Vienna at the Magistrate's
        Finance Department (MA 5). During this time I enrolled in the Master's
        Programme for Information and Media Law at the University of Vienna's
        Faculty of Law (Juridicum).

      <h3>Personal<br></h3>
      <p>
        In my off time, I enjoy developing side-projects, for example in
        areas like AI and Algo Trading.
        Besides, I engage in volunteer work around topics I care about, for
        example representing my university at Austria's largest education fair
        (BeSt Vienna).&nbsp;I am also proud to be appointed as a 1st
        Deputy EU Returning Officer for the 2024 election year and am a member
        of the Foreign Policy and United Nations Association of Austria.
