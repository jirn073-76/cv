      <h3>Short CV</h3>
      <p>
        In 2021, I completed my diploma in Computer Science and Software Engineering at HTL Donaustadt with highest distinction. 
        Afterwards, I began working in Investment Banking / Quantitative Finance at Raiffeisen Centrobank, developing tools for Structuring & Trading while studying 
        Business Informatics at the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Vienna. During this time, I participated in a study abroad programme at Iowa State University of Science and Technology (Ames, USA), 
        where I majored in Management Information Systems at the Ivy College of Business and was placed on the 2022 Dean's List.
      </p>
      <p>
        After returning in early 2023, I started working as a Software Engineer at IBM, where I got involved in developing AI Solutions for enterprise customers in the steel manufacturing industry. 
        In the same year, I enrolled in the Master’s programmes for Software Engineering at UAS Technikum (Vienna, Austria) and 
        Computer Science at Università degli Studi Guglielmo Marconi (Rome, Italy).
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2024, I began working for the City of Vienna at the Magistrate's Finance Department (MA 5), where I served in the Strategy Unit. 
        In this role, I led the department’s digitalization efforts, acting as advisor to the Financial Director and project manager for two key strategic projects, 
        under direct orders by the Executive City Councillor for Finance and the Financial Director. 
        During this time, I also enrolled in the Master’s programme for Information and Media Law at the University of Vienna’s Faculty of Law (Juridicum).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since May 2025, I'm working as an independent contractor, developing software for the public insurance sector. 
        In the same year, I started my role as a professor at the TGM, a renowned technology school in Vienna, where I teach Software Engineering with a focus on object-oriented programming, project management, and big data.</p>

      <h3>Personal<br></h3>
      <p>
        In my off time, I enjoy developing side-projects, for example in
        areas like AI and Algorithmic Trading.
        Besides, I engage in volunteer work around topics I care about, for
        example representing my university at Austria's largest annual education fair
        (BeSt Vienna).&nbsp;I am also proud to be appointed as a 1st
        Deputy National and EU Returning Officer for the 2024 election year and am a member
        of the Foreign Policy and United Nations Association of Austria.
